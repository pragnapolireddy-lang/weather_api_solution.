1. AI-Powered Data Quality Checks

- Train an anomaly detection model (e.g., Isolation Forest, LSTM) on historical weather data.

Automatically flag:

- Outlier values (e.g., 200°C max temp = bad data)

- Missing-data patterns

- Suspicious station readings (broken sensor detection)

2. Predictive Weather Insights

- Use historical weather trends to forecast temperature/precipitation at a station for the next season.

- Expose via /api/weather/forecast?station_id=XYZ&year=2025.

3. AI-Driven Crop Yield Prediction

- Join weather stats with crop yield data.

- Train a regression/ML model (XGBoost, LightGBM) to predict yield given weather patterns.

- Endpoint: /api/crops/predict?station_id=XYZ&year=2025.

4. Natural Language Query Interface

- Add a GenAI-powered query interface:

- User asks: “Show me average rainfall in Illinois in 2005”

- LLM converts it into an API call/SQL query under the hood.

- Could be implemented with LangChain + LLM over your DB.

5. Automated Documentation & Alerts

Use LLMs to:

- Generate human-readable summaries of yearly weather anomalies.

- Auto-generate alerts: “Station ABC had 30% higher rainfall than normal in 2010.”
