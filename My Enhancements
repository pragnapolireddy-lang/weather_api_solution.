Enhancements (Future Iterations)

Data & API Enhancements

1. Crop Yield Data Integration

- Extend schema to link weather stations with crop yield files.

- /api/crops endpoint → yield by region + weather correlation.

2. Caching Layer

- Use Redis/ElastiCache to speed up repetitive queries (/stats?year=2005).

3. Geo Support

- Store lat/lon for stations; add spatial queries (e.g., “all stations within 50km of X”).

4. Advanced Analytics Endpoints

- /api/weather/anomalies → detect unusual rainfall/temperature years.

- /api/weather/trends → long-term warming/cooling trend per station.

5. Visualization

- Basic dashboards (Plotly/Dash or embedded charts in Swagger UI).
